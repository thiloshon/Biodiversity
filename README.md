# Biodiversity
Centralized data retrieval, cleaning, management and backup tool for biodiversity data
The importance of data in the biodiversity research has been repeatedly stressed in the recent times and various organizations have come together and followed each other to provide data for advancing biodiversity research. But, that is exactly where the main hiccup of biodiversity research lies. Since there are many such organizations, the data aggregated by these organizations vary in precision and in quality. Further, though in recent times more researchers have started to use R for their data analyses, since they need to retrieve, manage and assess data with complex (DwC) structure and high volume, only researchers with extremely sound R programming background have been able to attempt this. So we propose to create a R Package that will function as the main data retrieval, cleaning, management and backup tool to the researchers
